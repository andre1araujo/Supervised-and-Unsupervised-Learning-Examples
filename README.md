# Project 02 - Implementation of *Machine Learning* algorithms

![Image](images/image-17.png?raw=true)

This project consists of implementing solutions to different problems using machine learning algorithms (*machine learning - ML*).
The project is divided into two themes:

  - **Supervised Learning:** Three automatic classification methods (**K-NN**, **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**) will be presented to solve a specific problem using the same database. The objective is to convey the usefulness of these methods for a more real problem and obtain important knowledge in this field. 
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** In this second part, two different problems will be presented on the same database, one of which will be solved using the *clustering* **K-Means** method and the other will be solved with association rules and the **Apriori** algorithm. The objective of this part is also to implement the use of these algorithms for more realistic situations and also to obtain some experience in the field.

This project is associated with the notebook **ML_Notebook.pynb** and to run it correctly, despite already being mentioned in it, it will be necessary to install the following packages using *PIP*:

  1. `pip install pandas`
  2. `pip install numpy`
  3. `pip install -U scikit-learn`
  4. `pip install matplotlib`
  5. `pip install mpl-toolkits.clifford`
  6. `pip install seaborn`
  7. `pip install mlxtend`
  8. `pip install imblearn`

To do this, you can use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the appropriate environment to install all the packages mentioned above and run the Notebook related to Project 02.

In the end, the user will have learned the following knowledge:

  - What is *machine learning*;
  - What is a Dataset/Database;
  - What is supervised learning;
  - What is unsupervised learning;
  - How to apply the two types of *machine learning* discussed;
  - What is the *k-nn* method;
  - What is the *decision tree* method;
  - What is the *random forest* method;
  - What is *clustering* and the *k-means* method;
  - What are association rules and the *apriori* method;

Running and reading each notebook should be more than enough to solidly introduce the user to the basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence. Solving more real problems makes the association of concepts easier and will allow future projects to be based on the themes in the same structure.
